The COSTA dataset contains TOF-MRA images acquired at two different magnetic field strengths (1.5T and 3.0T), including 423 TOF-MRA images from 8 disparate data centers, which utilize MRI scanners from 4 distinct vendors. ```Six``` subsets of COSTA with manual annotations are online available. Please go to [HERE](https://imed.nimte.ac.cn/costa.html) to access the COSTA dataset and for more information.
